                                    Scientists, nurses, thinkers, bakers, engineers and builders make up the backbone of our economies. The United States remains the world’s most powerful country, in great part, because it attracts the world’s most talented and productive people. It is also the third most populous country in the world, behind only India and China. And for as long as robots and artificial intelligence fail to take over our jobs and engineer a welcome era of abundance, the ceiling of the world’s economies will remain largely fixed to the health and number of their working-age adults.

                                    The world is aging, and more births would be a partial solution to the emerging shortage of working-age adults worldwide. Yet they would be no silver bullet. In the short term, higher fertility rates worsen dependency ratios (newborns don’t work); in the long term, they leave us with the sky-high social and economic costs of aging. In a rational universe, healthy aging would be a top priority of governments, foundations, families, and investors worldwide. Yet many market failures and misaligned incentives stand in the way of private and public investments into extending healthy life.

                                        It is often more profitable for a pharmaceutical company to lengthen the unhealthy life of a patient by a few months than to develop mechanisms that improve overall health. It’s prohibitively expensive to test drugs in dozens of disease indications (which could test health extension); easier to market “me too” drugs than to develop new ones; and difficult to retain patents and patients in long clinical trials (which could quantify life-years saved).

                                        Behavioral economics, too, can explain how “people are more willing to pay for a cure than for prevention.” Insurers, hospitals, and patients face a tragedy of the commons where all parties would be better off prioritizing long-term health, yet the incentives for individual agents to do so remain misaligned. For instance, because we’re free to change our health insurance, few insurers invest in our future health. And because governments largely subsidize our age-related health decline with programs like Medicare, we (and insurers) often underinvest in lifestyle choices like better diets — which can partly delay and even reverse some of the hallmarks of aging.

                                        Disease is often more easily measured than health. A therapeutic that preventatively extends the human healthspan is taken before its effects can be measured, and it compares against the unknowable counterfactual of how long the patient would have anyway lived in good health. All this leads to a system more prone to treating illness than preventing it; and to a backlog of undervalued therapeutics which, if tested and approved, could delay the onset of age-related health decline. (Think menopause, dementia, most cancers, and age-related infertility.)

                                    Age is the primary risk factor for the diseases of aging. The median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66; the first heart attack, 65; and a dementia diagnosis, 83. Biological aging is also a neglected factor in global pandemics and even rare diseases like progeria or childhood cancers, where patients experience a form of accelerated aging. This explains why the value of investing in research on aging biology is high even compared to other excellent investments, since most severe conditions are downstream of biological aging. Eliminating all cancers, for instance, would add between 2 and 3 years to life expectancy. But since the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66, the same patients would anyway soon be diagnosed with another manifestation of aging — like Parkinson’s, hypertension, severe illness from an otherwise mild infection, or a broken rib.

Today, the United States spends a mere 0.54% of its National Institutes of Health research budget on the biology of aging. Due to a number of market failures and misaligned incentives, the vast majority of public and private funds go towards the treatment of late-stage conditions.

                                    At its most compelling, aging science would enable full health extension, so that the function of all organs would be rejuvenated somewhat simultaneously (just as the decline of our organs is somewhat simultaneous). This, however, is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. And if one organ among all others should be prioritized for rejuvenation, it’s the brain. How do we rejuvenate the brain? Probably not by waiting until it has noticeably failed.

                                    Alzheimer’s research receives nearly $4 billion dollars annually from the United States government alone. Yet the existing focus on narrow approaches to the individual diseases of brain aging (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) has so far resulted in treatments whose risk-benefit profile remains discouraging. Research in this important area has traditionally neglected the root cause of most neurodegenerative diseases: namely, normal aging. Today, only 8% of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) budget is devoted to the biology of aging. Neurodegenerative diseases receive nearly 8 times more funding than fundamental research on aging biology. Yet brain function declines steadily with normal aging, with visible declines in cognitive performance at age 50. Therapeutics must be developed which prevent not just abnormal aging, but also this predictable decline.

                                    Though a distinction is often made between “healthy” brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, the boundary between normal and abnormal neurodegeneration is blurred. At age 65, “less than 5% of the population has a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, but this number increases to more than 40% beyond age 85.”
