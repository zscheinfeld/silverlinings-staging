                                    It’s a forgotten truth that — more than oil, gold, or data — working-age adults are the most valuable resource of our time.

                                    Scientists, nurses, thinkers, bakers, engineers and builders make up the backbone of our economies. The United States remains the world’s most powerful country, in great part, because it attracts the world’s most talented and productive people. It is also the third most populous country in the world, behind only India and China. And for as long as robots and artificial intelligence fail to take over our jobs and engineer a welcome era of abundance, the ceiling of the world’s economies will remain largely fixed to the health and number of their working-age adults.

                                    The world is aging, and more births would be a partial solution to the emerging shortage of working-age adults worldwide. Yet they would be no silver bullet. In the short term, higher fertility rates worsen dependency ratios (newborns don’t work); in the long term, they leave us with the sky-high social and economic costs of aging. In a rational universe, healthy aging would be a top priority of governments, foundations, families, and investors worldwide. Yet many market failures and misaligned incentives stand in the way of private and public investments into extending healthy life.

                                        It is often more profitable for a pharmaceutical company to lengthen the unhealthy life of a patient by a few months than to develop mechanisms that improve overall health. It’s prohibitively expensive to test drugs in dozens of disease indications (which could test health extension); easier to market “me too” drugs than to develop new ones; and difficult to retain patents and patients in long clinical trials (which could quantify life-years saved).

                                        Behavioral economics, too, can explain how “people are more willing to pay for a cure than for prevention.” Insurers, hospitals, and patients face a tragedy of the commons where all parties would be better off prioritizing long-term health, yet the incentives for individual agents to do so remain misaligned. For instance, because we’re free to change our health insurance, few insurers invest in our future health. And because governments largely subsidize our age-related health decline with programs like Medicare, we (and insurers) often underinvest in lifestyle choices like better diets — which can partly delay and even reverse some of the hallmarks of aging.

                                        Disease is often more easily measured than health. A therapeutic that preventatively extends the human healthspan is taken before its effects can be measured, and it compares against the unknowable counterfactual of how long the patient would have anyway lived in good health. All this leads to a system more prone to treating illness than preventing it; and to a backlog of undervalued therapeutics which, if tested and approved, could delay the onset of age-related health decline. (Think menopause, dementia, most cancers, and age-related infertility.)

                                    The diseases of aging still begin to show up at nearly the same age as they did in 300 BC — and they follow a predictable trajectory throughout our lifespan.

                                    Age is the primary risk factor for the diseases of aging. The median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66; the first heart attack, 65; and a dementia diagnosis, 83. Biological aging is also a neglected factor in global pandemics and even rare diseases like progeria or childhood cancers, where patients experience a form of accelerated aging. This explains why the value of investing in research on aging biology is high even compared to other excellent investments, since most severe conditions are downstream of biological aging. Eliminating all cancers, for instance, would add between 2 and 3 years to life expectancy. But since the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66, the same patients would anyway soon be diagnosed with another manifestation of aging — like Parkinson’s, hypertension, severe illness from an otherwise mild infection, or a broken rib.

                                    Scientific challenges help explain why we lack human-relevant results in aging biology. Yet they do not explain why, for instance, research on Alzheimer’s alone receives roughly 8 times more funding than research on the biology of aging, though we lack human-relevant results for safe Alzheimer’s drugs. Today, the United States spends a mere 0.54% of its National Institutes of Health research budget on the biology of aging. Due to a number of market failures and misaligned incentives, the vast majority of public and private funds go towards the treatment of late-stage conditions.

                                    Some species, like the Aldabra giant tortoise, are about as likely to die the moment they are born as they are at age 90. Others, like the jellyfish Turritopsis Dohrnii, are biologically immortal, and barring predators or rare diseases, can live for an indefinite amount of time. Mammals like the bowhead whale and fish like Greenland sharks routinely live for centuries without developing chronic illnesses like cancers or Alzheimer’s, while the health of naked-mole rats appears not to decline at all over time. Humans exhibit a similar ability for health maintenance until our twenties. Throughout our lives, our cells constantly undergo mutations and alterations. But as our natural capacity for repair begins to wane, damage begins to irreversibly accumulate. The same type of molecular damage that might have been easily tended to at a young age begins to build up during our thirties and forties. The diseases of aging — like cancers, heart diseases, dementias, and diabetes — most often appear after decades of misrepairs.

                                    It’s well established that some hallmarks of aging can be accelerated by habits like smoking, or by events like pregnancy and infection. Less obvious is the fact that biological aging can be slowed down and reversed. Indeed, some hallmarks of aging are temporarily reversed every day with diet, mental health practices, and exercise. Yet there is a low ceiling to what can be achieved with lifestyle interventions for primates with our DNA. Just as two-hundred-year-old tortoises won’t suddenly start aging poorly after several days of little movement on the beach, or after binge-eating the carcasses of other tortoises (a habit they sometimes indulge in), humans can’t buy cancer-free, two-hundred-year lives by self-starving or walking at giant-tortoise speed.

                                    You might think that death, economically speaking, is a net positive, since it mostly occurs to people dependent on costly social and medical care.

Healthy humans, of course, would impose fewer burdens on our medical and social systems. But even half-healthy humans are by far more productive (as well as happier and healthier) than dead ones; and more newborns are generally worth more to the U.S. GDP, in the long run, than fewer.

                                    The holy grail of aging science — and arguably of medicine — is to extend health at the same pace that it extends life. This would have substantial effects on the global economy, lowering the burden on caregivers, care receivers, and young populations who in part subsidize the medical and social care of older adults. Longer-lived and more productive humans would also lead to higher investments in human capital: more education, more spending, and more productive labor.

                                    Economic growth is broadly driven by two factors: growth in the population, and growth in the amount each worker can produce within a given time. Labor productivity is the most direct way in which increases in healthspan impact the economy’s output. And in any century of recorded productivity so far, one pattern is clear: labor productivity rises in the first part of working life as experience and human capital accumulate, then declines later in life, as declines in physical and cognitive function overwhelm the increases in human capital. Improving the biology of aging implies slowing the rates of cognitive and physical decline later in life, which translates into slower decline in labor productivity.

Yet the existing focus on narrow approaches to the individual diseases of brain aging (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) has so far resulted in treatments whose risk-benefit profile remains discouraging. Research in this important area has traditionally neglected the root cause of most neurodegenerative diseases: namely, normal aging. Today, only 8% of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) budget is devoted to the biology of aging. Neurodegenerative diseases receive nearly 8 times more funding than fundamental research on aging biology. Yet brain function declines steadily with normal aging, with visible declines in cognitive performance at age 50. Therapeutics must be developed which prevent not just abnormal aging, but also this predictable decline.

                                        It is often more profitable for a pharmaceutical company to lengthen the unhealthy life of a patient by a few months than to develop mechanisms that improve overall health. It’s prohibitively expensive to test drugs in dozens of disease indications (which could test health extension); easier to market “me too” drugs than to develop new ones; and difficult to retain patents and patients in long clinical trials (which could quantify life-years saved).

                                        Behavioral economics, too, can explain how “people are more willing to pay for a cure than for prevention.” Insurers, hospitals, and patients face a tragedy of the commons where all parties would be better off prioritizing long-term health, yet the incentives for individual agents to do so remain misaligned. For instance, because we’re free to change our health insurance, few insurers invest in our future health. And because governments largely subsidize our age-related health decline with programs like Medicare, we (and insurers) often underinvest in lifestyle choices like better diets — which can partly delay and even reverse some of the hallmarks of aging.

                                        Disease is often more easily measured than health. A therapeutic that preventatively extends the human healthspan is taken before its effects can be measured, and it compares against the unknowable counterfactual of how long the patient would have anyway lived in good health. All this leads to a system more prone to treating illness than preventing it; and to a backlog of undervalued therapeutics which, if tested and approved, could delay the onset of age-related health decline. (Think menopause, dementia, most cancers, and age-related infertility.)

                                    The diseases of aging still begin to show up at nearly the same age as they did in 300 BC — and they follow a predictable trajectory throughout our lifespan.

                                    Age is the primary risk factor for the diseases of aging. The median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66; the first heart attack, 65; and a dementia diagnosis, 83. Biological aging is also a neglected factor in global pandemics and even rare diseases like progeria or childhood cancers, where patients experience a form of accelerated aging. This explains why the value of investing in research on aging biology is high even compared to other excellent investments, since most severe conditions are downstream of biological aging. Eliminating all cancers, for instance, would add between 2 and 3 years to life expectancy. But since the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66, the same patients would anyway soon be diagnosed with another manifestation of aging — like Parkinson’s, hypertension, severe illness from an otherwise mild infection, or a broken rib.

                                    Scientific challenges help explain why we lack human-relevant results in aging biology. Yet they do not explain why, for instance, research on Alzheimer’s alone receives roughly 8 times more funding than research on the biology of aging, though we lack human-relevant results for safe Alzheimer’s drugs. Today, the United States spends a mere 0.54% of its National Institutes of Health research budget on the biology of aging. Due to a number of market failures and misaligned incentives, the vast majority of public and private funds go towards the treatment of late-stage conditions.
